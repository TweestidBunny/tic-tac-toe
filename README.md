# Tic-Tac-Toe

No thrills, no frills, this is what the heading
says, a tic-tac-toe game. Do you think you have
what it takes to play with yourself and finish
first? Well, give it a go.

This is a project on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
The purpose is to practice creating a game app
using as few global variables as possible.
In other words, this will be created using
nothing but factory functions and modules. If
possible.

The page itself will have very little HTML in
it, since the majority will be created using
JavaScript. Which, as the last part mentions,
will be done from inside an object created
using a module.
